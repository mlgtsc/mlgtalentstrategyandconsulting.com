After more than 25 years in the industry I decided it was time to make a big change.  I knew I wanted to stay in this crazy business, but wanted more autonomy.  I also wanted to relocate to a warmer climate.  So, I left a wonderful job and started consulting in 2016 with the goal of helping clients produce the best creative while keeping costs in line with their budgets. It took a couple more years to move to Florida, but I’m happy to say that I’m settled and enjoying the warmer winters.

Starting my career at Leo Burnett in Chicago, I began as a script typist and continued to prove my value being promoted 5 times culminating in the role of Associate Director of Broadcast Business. I represented Leo Burnett at the AAAA Central Broadcast Committee and within a short period was appointed the Chairperson of that committee. After 12 years at Burnett, I joined JWT Chicago as Director of Broadcast Business Affairs for 3 years and then moved on to Element 79 Partners, leading their business affairs department for 7 years.  I continued as Chairperson of the AAAA Committee and was appointed to the Joint Policy Committee while at Element 79 Partners.

In 2010, I moved to New York to lead the business affairs division of The TEAM Companies.  Although I continued to utilize the experience I had gained over the years I learned a lot about entertainment payroll and labor law.  It was great meeting and working with so many new and wonderful advertising professionals.
Over the years I have been fortunate enough to work on a variety of accounts including McDonald’s, Kellogg’s, Miller Brewing, Gatorade, Capital One and Nabsico.  Since I started consulting, I’ve worked with various partners on projects for John Deere, Jeep, Google and 84 Lumber, among others.
